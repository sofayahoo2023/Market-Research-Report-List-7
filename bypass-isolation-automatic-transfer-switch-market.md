<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bypass Isolation Automatic Transfer Switch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Transition</li><li>Closed Transition</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Bypass Isolation Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) market is primarily categorized into two types: Open Transition and Closed Transition. Open Transition switches create a momentary disconnection from the power source during the transfer, ensuring no backfeed occurs. This type is simpler and more cost-effective but can cause brief power interruptions. Closed Transition switches, on the other hand, seamlessly switch between sources without power interruption by making a brief connection between the two sources. This provides higher reliability and stability for critical applications.</p></p>
