<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vial Access Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vented</li><li>Non-vented</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vial access devices facilitate the safe and efficient withdrawal of fluids from vials. The market is primarily divided into vented and non-vented types. Vented devices allow air to enter the vial as fluid is withdrawn, preventing collapse and ensuring consistent flow. In contrast, non-vented devices utilize pressure differential techniques and do not require air entry, making them ideal for specific applications where contamination risk must be minimized. Both types cater to diverse healthcare needs, including drug delivery and sample collection.</p></p>
