<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cysticercosis Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Praziquantel</li><li>Albendazole</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cysticercosis treatment primarily involves two antiparasitic medications: Praziquantel and Albendazole. Praziquantel disrupts the parasite's skin, leading to its death and is often preferred for neurocysticercosis due to its effectiveness against adult and larval forms. Albendazole, on the other hand, inhibits glucose uptake in parasites, leading to their deterioration. Both drugs can be used in conjunction with corticosteroids to reduce inflammation caused by dying parasites. The market for these treatments is influenced by factors such as efficacy, safety profiles, and accessibility.</p></p>
