<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pelvis Reconstruction Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Locking</li><li>Non-Locking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pelvis reconstruction plate market is categorized into locking and non-locking plates. Locking plates feature screws that secure the plate to the bone, providing enhanced stability and allowing for fixed-angle constructs, which minimizes the risk of screw backout. Non-locking plates, on the other hand, rely on friction between the screws and the plate for stability, offering a more traditional fixation method. Both types serve critical roles in pelvic fracture management, with choices depending on the specific clinical requirements and fracture types.</p></p>
