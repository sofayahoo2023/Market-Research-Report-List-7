<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-ray Source Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Open-tube"</li><li>"Sealed-tube"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The X-ray source market is primarily divided into two types: open-tube and sealed-tube sources. Open-tube X-ray sources utilize a vacuum environment where electrons are accelerated towards a target, creating X-rays. These sources offer higher output and flexibility but require careful handling. In contrast, sealed-tube X-ray sources are pre-loaded with a specific gas or material, ensuring safety and reliability while minimizing radiation leakage. Both types are essential for various applications, including medical imaging, industrial inspections, and research.</p></p>
